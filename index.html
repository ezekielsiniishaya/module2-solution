						<div class="p">What a blessing it is to learn. I walked the crooked path that was laid for me. I had no choice, for I do not know any better, but nevertheless I am glad. Through the thick and thin, the hurt and pain, the shear force of life was all around me and I had no option but to learn.</div>
